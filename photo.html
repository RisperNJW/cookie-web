    <p>Sugar Cookie Ingredients <br>
    <hr>
    These are the simple ingredients you'll need to make the best sugar cookies of your life:
    <br>
    Flour: This easy sugar cookie recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
    <br>
    Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cookies rise.
    <br>
    Butter: Two sticks of butter add moisture and richness.
    <br>
    Sugar: Of course, you'll need sugar for sugar cookies!
    <br>
    Egg: An egg lends more moisture and helps bind the cookie dough together.
